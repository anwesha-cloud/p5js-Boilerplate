# Sprite Collision Demo – 2020

> ⚠️ Note: This is a very old JavaScript project using p5.js and p5.play libraries.
> It was created as an early interactive demo to experiment with sprite movement and collision detection.

Collision between movingRect and fixedRect is handled using bounceOff() logic.

Features

Interactive Movement: Move the green rectangle with the mouse.

Collision Detection: movingRect bounces off fixedRect when they collide.

Simple Setup: Perfect for learning sprite interaction, velocities, and basic physics in p5.js.
